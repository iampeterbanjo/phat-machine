# Phat Machine

Phat machine lives to make phat beats using Angular2 like a dope drum machine.

## Development

- `git clone git@github.com:iampeterbanjo/phat-machine.git`

- cd phat-machine

- npm install

- `ng serve`

PS: This started out as an idea for the Angular Attack 2016 hackathon but lives on because phat beats never die.
